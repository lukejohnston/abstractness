Abstractness Finder

A little web app that demonstrates the principle described in xkcd.com/903 (look
at the alt text).

Written in python for Google App Engine. If you want to deploy your own instance
just change the app name in app.yaml. It uses the URLfetch system to get pages
from Wikipedia, BeautifulSoup to parse them and the datastore to cache the
results. Processing the pages is expensive so the more cache hits the better.

Notable files:

main.py - Contains all the webapp and datastore stuff
wiki.py - Does the URL fetching and HTML parsing
*.html - Templates
