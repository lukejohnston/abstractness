        <blockquote>Wikipedia trivia: If you take any article, click on the
            first link in the article text not in parentheses or italics, and
            then repeat, you will eventually end up at "Philosophy".

            Inspired by this, abstractness is 
            defined as the number of
            clicks it take to get from a wikipedia article to Philosophy. The
            fewer steps, the more abstract it is! </p>
